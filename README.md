# RiverpodPokeAPI

A Flutter application that uses Riverpod for state management to fetch data from the PokeAPI and display a list of Pokémon in a GridView with a shimmer loading effect. This project demonstrates clean architecture principles, asynchronous data fetching, and responsive UI with Flutter.

- **GridView Layout:** Displays Pokémon in a clean, responsive `GridView` layout, ensuring optimal use of screen space.
- **Shimmer Loading Effect:** Implements a shimmer effect to indicate loading while fetching data, providing a smooth visual experience.
- **Simple and Responsive UI:** Designed with user experience in mind, offering an intuitive interface that works well on various screen sizes.
